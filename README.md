# VBA-challenge
In this project, I analyzed and organized different tickers from the stock market.
Every sheet is separated by year with the initial, max, min, and end values of each stock per date.
I coded a macro to compare the end of the year price to the beginning of the year price per stock.
If the stock decreased in the value, the cell was be red, and if it increased, the cell was green.
I also included the percent changed per stock and the total stock volume.
